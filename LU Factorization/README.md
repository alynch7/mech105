# LU Factorization

the function luFactor performs LU decomposition on a system of equations and produces a lower trianglular matrix, an upper triangular matrix, and a pivot matrix

**** CALL FUNCTION USING FORMAT [L,U,P] = luFactor(A) ****

If you would like to know the inverse of A as well, call using [L,U,P,invA] = luFactor(A)

### INPUTS

A - Coefficient matrix

### OUTPUTS

L - Lower trianglular matrix

U - Upper triangular matrix

P - Pivot matrix
